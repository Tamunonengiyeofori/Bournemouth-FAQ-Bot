# **University Chatbot with Advanced NLP and LLM Integration**

Welcome to the repository for the **University Chatbot Project**! This project aims to build a robust, context-based chatbot designed to provide accurate and conversational responses to user queries. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this chatbot connects large language models (LLMs) to external data sources, ensuring reliable and real-time information retrieval.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Data Collection**: Automates data collection by webscraping information from university websites and extracts useful information from PDF files using `PyPDF2`. The extracted data undergoes cleaning, processing, and transformation for use in the chatbot.
- **LLM Connection**: Uses Langchain to integrate large language models (OpenAI, Gemini) with external data sources for accurate query resolution.
- **Vector Database**: Implements Pinecone for efficient storage and fast retrieval of data, enabling the chatbot to perform accurate and quick searches.
- **Multilingual Support**: Provides responses in multiple languages (e.g., Spanish, Italian) to support diverse user groups.
- **Interactive UI**: Built using Streamlit, the web interface offers an intuitive and user-friendly platform for engaging with the chatbot.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Ensures robustness with evaluation metrics such as BERT score and other LLM-specific evaluation measures.
- **Deployment**: Deployed using Render for free hosting, with Docker for containerization and potential cloud integration (e.g., Azure).
- **CI/CD**: Utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery, ensuring streamlined collaboration and project updates.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Includes logging mechanisms to track the chatbot's performance and identify areas for improvement.
